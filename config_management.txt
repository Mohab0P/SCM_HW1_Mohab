Configuration management is essential in software development because it:

Ensures Consistency: Maintains uniformity across different environments by tracking and controlling changes.
Enhances Collaboration: Facilitates coordinated work among team members by providing a single source of truth.
Improves Traceability: Records all modifications, allowing teams to track what changed, when, and why.
Enables Automation: Supports automated builds, testing, and deployments, reducing manual errors.
Simplifies Rollbacks: Makes it easier to revert to previous versions if issues arise, improving system stability.
