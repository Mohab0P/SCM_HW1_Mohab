Configuration management is essential in software development because it:

Ensures Consistency: Maintains uniformity across different environments by tracking and controlling changes.
Enhances Collaboration: Facilitates coordinated work among team members by providing a single source of truth.
Improves Traceability: Records all modifications, allowing teams to track what changed, when, and why.
Enables Automation: Supports automated builds, testing, and deployments, reducing manual errors.
Simplifies Rollbacks: Makes it easier to revert to previous versions if issues arise, improving system stability.

Best Practices in Software Configuration Management

    Use version control systems like Git to track changes and maintain a history.

    Follow branching strategies (e.g., Git Flow) to manage different versions.

    Write clear commit messages to describe changes accurately.

    Use pull requests & code reviews for quality control before merging.

    Automate builds & testing with CI/CD pipelines to ensure reliability.
